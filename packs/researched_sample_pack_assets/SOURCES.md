# Research Sources Used (for rationale, not copied verbatim)

These sources informed the stage thresholds and several rubric items (e.g., 50-employee compliance triggers, first HR hire timing, onboarding metrics, HRIS adoption timing).

## HR maturity / assessments
- SHRM: HR maturity assessments overview (purpose: identify strengths and growth opportunities given current state).
- AIHR: HR maturity model overview (progression from basic to advanced HR).

## Headcount / when HR becomes necessary
- ERC (Employee Resource Center): analysis suggesting first dedicated HR hire often occurs around 40–50 employees; most have HR by ~100.
- Human Interest: discusses the “50-employee threshold” as a common inflection point in HR needs and compliance concerns.

## US compliance thresholds (examples; not legal advice)
- U.S. Dept. of Labor (WHD) FMLA Fact Sheet #28: covered employers generally include private employers with 50+ employees (with specifics).
- IRS: Applicable Large Employer / employer shared responsibility provisions typically apply at 50+ full-time (including FTE) employees.
- EEOC: EEO-1 reporting generally required for private employers with 100+ employees (and certain federal contractors with 50+).

## Onboarding measurement and practices
- SHRM: suggests measuring onboarding using metrics like time-to-productivity and turnover/retention.
- iCIMS (checklist guidance): recommends onboarding surveys at 30/60/90 days as a feedback mechanism.

## HRIS timing
- AIHR (HRIS overview): notes HRIS becomes interesting/valuable around 30–50 employees when spreadsheets become cumbersome.

## Compensation structure
- BambooHR: salary banding benefits and practical guidance.
