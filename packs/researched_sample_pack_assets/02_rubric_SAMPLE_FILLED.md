## S0 — Foundations (0–10)
**Context:** Founder-led HR; speed matters more than process, but basics prevent painful mistakes.

### Compliance & Policies
- Must-haves: basic offer letter template; worker classification awareness; I-9 process owner; anti-harassment expectations.
- Red flags: undocumented pay practices; contractor arrangements without written terms; no recordkeeping.
- Good enough: a short “people basics” doc + shared folder of templates.
- Artifacts: offer letter template; contractor agreement template; I-9 checklist; basic policy memo.

### Hiring & Recruiting
- Must-haves: clear role definition; simple interview loop; consistent offer approval.
- Red flags: hiring without role clarity; inconsistent compensation promises.
- Good enough: job scorecard + 3–5 structured questions.

### Onboarding
- Must-haves: Day 1 setup checklist; access provisioning; 30-day goals.
- Metrics: time-to-productivity proxy; early churn (0–90 days) tracking.

### Manager Enablement
- Must-haves: expectations for 1:1s and feedback (even if informal).

### Performance & Feedback
- Must-haves: lightweight goal setting; monthly feedback cadence.

### Compensation & Leveling
- Must-haves: basic ranges or guardrails per role family; offer consistency.
- Red flags: “whatever we negotiated” without guardrails.

### Systems & Data
- Must-haves: one source of truth for headcount + titles + pay; basic time-off tracking.

### Retention/ER/Engagement
- Must-haves: simple pulse check; exit notes; escalation path for concerns.

## S1 — Structured Basics (11–40)
**Context:** Informal approaches start breaking; consistency reduces risk and improves hiring speed.

### Compliance & Policies
- Must-haves: minimum policy set + handbook outline; clear time-off policy; code of conduct; complaint reporting path.
- Red flags: multi-state employees without localized policy review; no documentation of investigations/complaints.
- Good enough: handbook v0 (core policies) + acknowledgements.

### Hiring & Recruiting
- Must-haves: interview scorecards; basic recruiting funnel tracking; standard offer process.
- Red flags: inconsistent hiring decisions; offer renegotiations due to unclear ranges.
- Good enough: ATS-lite tracker + weekly hiring standup during growth.

### Onboarding
- Must-haves: onboarding checklist (preboarding → first 30 days); manager-owned 30/60/90 expectations; buddy system.
- Metrics: time-to-productivity and early retention are recommended onboarding measures (see SOURCES.md).

### Manager Enablement
- Must-haves: manager expectations doc; 1:1 cadence; basics of feedback and documentation.
- Red flags: managers handling ER issues ad-hoc.

### Performance & Feedback
- Must-haves: lightweight quarterly goals; “what good looks like” for common roles.

### Compensation & Leveling
- Must-haves: role families + basic leveling/ranges where hiring is active; consistent offer approvals.
- Good enough: 3-level structure (e.g., Junior/Mid/Senior) for core functions.

### Systems & Data
- Must-haves: payroll/benefits owner; time-off workflow; employee file organization.
- Good enough: lightweight HRIS or standardized spreadsheets + approvals.

### Retention/ER/Engagement
- Must-haves: exit interview notes; early churn review; simple engagement pulse.

## S2 — Scaling (41–100)
**Context:** This is a common inflection point for dedicated HR ownership and increased compliance/process complexity (see SOURCES.md).

### Compliance & Policies
- Must-haves: handbook v1; manager documentation norms; training calendar; standardized investigations/discipline flow.
- “Threshold prompts”: awareness of 50+ employee obligations like FMLA/ACA reporting considerations (see SOURCES.md).
- Good enough: documented core workflows + annual policy review cadence.

### Hiring & Recruiting
- Must-haves: structured interview loops; recruiting ops ownership; source/channel tracking; offer approval workflow.
- Red flags: hiring velocity without onboarding capacity → quality and churn issues.

### Onboarding
- Must-haves: role-based onboarding; 30/60/90 plans; onboarding surveys at key intervals (30/60/90) as a feedback loop (see SOURCES.md).

### Manager Enablement
- Must-haves: manager training (feedback, coaching, documentation, basics of leave/ADA accommodations routing); manager onboarding.

### Performance & Feedback
- Must-haves: formal-ish performance cycle (at least 2x/year) + calibration-lite; promotion criteria.

### Compensation & Leveling
- Must-haves: salary bands/ranges for common roles; leveling v1; consistent offers.
- Rationale: salary bands improve consistency and fairness (see SOURCES.md).

### Systems & Data
- Must-haves: HRIS adopted/implemented or implementation plan; clean data definitions (title, level, location, manager).
- Rationale: HRIS often becomes attractive around 30–50 employees (see SOURCES.md).

### Retention/ER/Engagement
- Must-haves: stay interviews for key roles; manager coaching for top attrition drivers; ER log.
