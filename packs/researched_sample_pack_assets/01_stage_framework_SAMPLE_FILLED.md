# HR Stage Framework (Headcount + Complexity) — Sample (Researched)

> This is an example “consultant pack” framework for US-based SMBs and startups.  
> It flags compliance-related thresholds as *risk prompts*, not legal advice.

## A) Stages (primary classifier)

| Stage ID | Stage name | Headcount range | Typical situation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| S0 | Foundations | 0–10 | Founder-led HR admin; informal policies; lightweight hiring + onboarding. |
| S1 | Structured Basics | 11–40 | Process starts breaking: need consistent offers, onboarding, basic policies, manager norms. |
| S2 | Scaling | 41–100 | First dedicated HR often appears around here; consistency, manager enablement, and compliance complexity increase. |
| S3 | Operational Maturity | 101–250 | Repeatable performance cycle, leveling v1, recruiting ops; HRIS data hygiene and reporting. |
| S4 | Specialization | 251–500 | HR roles specialize (Talent, HRBP/People Ops, Comp/Benefits); operating model and workforce planning. |
| S5 | Enterprise | 500+ | Governance, COEs, service delivery, analytics; audits, risk mgmt, and employee relations maturity. |

### Why these bands (high-level rationale)
- Many orgs make their first dedicated HR hire around **40–50 employees**, and most have at least one HR FTE by **~100** (see SOURCES.md).  
- **50 employees** is a common US compliance inflection point (e.g., FMLA coverage considerations; ACA Applicable Large Employer rules) — used here as a “checklist prompt,” not legal advice (see SOURCES.md).  
- HRIS adoption often becomes attractive around **30–50 employees** when spreadsheets stop scaling (see SOURCES.md).

## B) Complexity triggers (bump “effective stage”)

| Trigger | What counts as “true” | Stage bump | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Multi-state | Employees in 2+ US states | +1 | Adds wage/hour and leave-policy complexity; postings/pay rules vary by state. |
| Multi-country | Employees in 2+ countries | +2 | Local employment law + payroll + benefits differences; usually requires specialist support. |
| Regulated | Healthcare/fintech/gov contracting, etc. | +1 | Often increases policy/training/security requirements. |
| High growth | Hiring > 10% headcount/month OR > 50% YoY | +1 | Recruiting + onboarding become constraints; quality and retention risks rise. |
| Contractor-heavy | Contractors > 25% of workforce | +1 | Classification and process consistency becomes a recurring risk area. |
| Union/works council | Present or likely | +2 | ER processes and negotiation cadence require experienced support. |
| High ER load | Frequent conflicts, complaints, investigations | +1 | Requires clear policies, manager training, and case management. |

## C) Confidence rules (how cautious the tool should be)

- If headcount is **missing** → Stage confidence = Low unless strong proxies exist (e.g., staffing plan, org chart, customer counts).
- If only public info is provided (website/blog) → apply a confidence penalty (Medium).
- If key metrics are missing (attrition, hiring volume, locations) → apply a confidence penalty (Low–Medium depending on gaps).
- If core artifacts are missing (offer template, handbook/policies, onboarding doc) → treat related findings as “Not found,” not “Absent.”
