# Prioritization Rules — Sample (Researched)

## Default weights (suggested)
- Compliance risk: **High**
- Business impact (retention/hiring velocity): **High**
- Urgency/time-sensitive: **Medium**
- Effort preference (quick wins): **Somewhat**
- Confidence penalty: **High** (don’t over-rank uncertain findings)

## Always-high-priority items (examples)
- Worker classification / contractor-heavy risk prompts
- I-9 process ownership and timeliness prompts
- Clear complaint reporting + manager documentation norms
- Onboarding capacity during high hiring velocity

## “Depends” rules
- If hiring > 10% headcount/month → prioritize onboarding + recruiting ops + manager capacity first.
- If multi-state → prioritize policy localization prompts, time-off/leave policy clarity, and pay transparency posting prompts.
- If early churn (0–90 days) is elevated → prioritize onboarding + manager enablement + role clarity.
