  Generate an evidence-grounded HR Assessment Report for startup companies that
  identifies optimal HR structure, recommended employment practices, and stage-specific
  risks by company size and funding stage.
report_focus_points:
  - "Align output to the HR Assessment Report template structure."
  - "Use complete sentence-level citations and avoid partial snippets."
  - "Evaluate by size bands: <20, 20-49, 50-99, 100-250, and 250+ employees."
  - "Evaluate by funding stages: Seed, Series A, Series B, and Series C+."
  - "Provide practical, stage-fit recommendations and avoid over-building too early."
  - "Avoid arbitrary numeric scoring and do not produce a 30/60/90-day action plan section."

      - "Define repeatable hiring and onboarding basics before hiring velocity increases."

prompt_overrides:
  snapshot_guidance: >
    Favor evidence that directly indicates whether a control exists, is missing, or is
    ambiguous. Keep citations as complete standalone sentences and avoid clipped excerpts.
  synthesis_style: >
    Consultant-grade and practical. Tie observations to startup stage and size context, and
    clearly separate confirmed findings from hypotheses that need validation.
