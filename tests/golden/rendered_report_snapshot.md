# HR Growth Areas Assessment

Based on the indicated sources we reviewed, this assessment prioritizes likely growth areas and confirmation needs.

## Stage and Scale
- Stage: **11-40 employees**
- Confidence: **74%**
- Stage note: Stage inferred from proxies; explicit headcount not found.

### Drivers
- Headcount explicitly stated as 22.

## Coverage Note
Sources reviewed were primarily onboarding/time-off pages; other domains may not be covered.

## Coverage Summary

## Prioritized Growth Areas
