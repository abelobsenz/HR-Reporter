Policies / employee experience snippets (fictional)

- There is no single employee handbook. Policies are scattered in Notion pages.
- Time off: "Unlimited" but no documented guidance. People ask Finance for approvals.
- Complaint reporting: employees are told to "talk to their manager or the founders."
- No documented process for investigations or discipline.
- US work authorization: founder says "we collect docs" but no written I-9 checklist.
