People Ops notes (fictional)

Hiring:
- Interviewing is unstructured; panels vary by team.
- No consistent scorecards; decisions happen in Slack.
- Offer approvals: founders approve verbally; comp is negotiated.

Onboarding:
- New hires receive access to tools within 1–5 days depending on IT availability.
- No standard Day 1 schedule. Some hires wait days for clear tasks.
- No 30/60/90 expectations by role; depends on manager.

Managers:
- 12 managers; 7 are first-time managers.
- 1:1s "when we can" (often skipped during sprints).
- Managers ask: "How do we document performance issues?"

Metrics:
- 12-month voluntary attrition: unknown
- 0–90 day attrition: 3 people left within first 60 days last quarter (roles unclear + onboarding gaps)
