Ops notes (fictional)

- Store managers report:
  - "We lose new hires in the first month; they feel unprepared."
  - "We don’t have consistent coaching scripts for performance."
- Owner wants:
  - lower turnover
  - faster time-to-competency for baristas
  - fewer escalations and last-minute terminations without documentation
- HR capacity:
  - One payroll admin part-time; no dedicated HRBP
