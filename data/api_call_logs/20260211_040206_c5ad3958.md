## About This Assessment
This internal draft evaluates HR maturity and business impact across core functional areas.

Maturity scale:
- `Under-Developed` = reactive or inconsistent controls
- `Developing` = foundational controls exist but are uneven
- `Aligned` = repeatable and documented controls
- `Strategic` = integrated, scalable, and metrics-driven controls

Impact scale:
- `Significant` = materially affects growth, risk, retention, or execution
- `Moderate` = meaningful operational effect, but not existential
- `Limited` = useful improvements, lower urgency at current stage

## Methodology and Data Sources
- Reviewed uploaded files, pasted notes, and supplied URLs.
- Extracted evidence by HR control using deterministic retrieval over chunked sources.
- Generated findings only when controls were explicitly missing or not confirmed in sources; explicit citations were retained where available.
- Reviewed 18 document(s) and 37 evidence chunk(s).
- Source count in assessment packet: 18.

### Source Coverage
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| URLs seeded/fetched | 0 / 0 |
| URL fetch failures | 0 |
| Retrieved docs/chunks | 18 / 37 |
| Domains | None |

**Coverage note:** Sources were prioritized toward broad HR controls; niche/local pages were deprioritized unless directly relevant.

## Stage-Based Recommendations
**Stage context:** Series B | 50-99 employees

**Recommended HR structure:** People lead with specialist support across Talent, HR Operations, and Rewards; increase rigor while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

### Recommended Employment Practices
- Implement leveling/pay bands and documented compensation review governance.
- Stand up leadership development for first-line managers and emerging leaders.
- Institutionalize ER intake, investigation workflow, and escalation standards.
- Use engagement/attrition signals to target retention interventions by team/manager.

### Potential Stage Risks
- Role ambiguity between generalist and specialist ownership slows execution.
- Compensation inconsistency creates fairness and retention risk.
- Manager capability variance becomes a major performance bottleneck.

### Additional Observations
#### D1. Support spans of control may be narrowly defined (2–4 reps per cohort)
**Area:** Org design and span of control | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Evidence states: “Maintains regular, productive communication with cohorts of 2-4 Reps.” If applied as a standard span for Support managers, this could create managerial overhead and slow scaling at 50–99 employees. Right-size spans and clarify when leads vs. managers carry coaching loads.

**Evidence**
- `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005` Communicates service standards and requirements reliably and effectively to reports.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Is 2–4 direct reports the intended span of control for Support managers today, and what is the target span as the team scales (e.g., 6–8+)?

#### D2. Remote onboarding uses Basecamp and assigned buddies; add 30/60/90 feedback loop
**Area:** Onboarding | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Confirmed: "On your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called “Welcome, [your name]!”" and "Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks." For a Series B team scaling remotely, adding structured 30/60/90 feedback ensures consistency and continuous improvement of the onboarding experience.

**Evidence**
- `doc-004-getting-started-c001` Getting started at 37signals involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Do you run a structured 30/60/90-day onboarding feedback survey and debrief between the new hire, manager, and buddies?

#### D3. Engineering on-call responsibilities require HR-aligned stipend and recovery policies
**Area:** Workforce Operations | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Confirmed: "Participates in programmer on-call shifts with guidance from a more senior team member." and "Can recognize and raise major incidents and lead the response from inception to resolution." At Series B, formalizing on-call compensation, recovery time, and equitable rotation policies helps prevent burnout and supports retention.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003` A leader on the team, technically and culturally.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Do you provide on-call compensation and next-day recovery time, and is the rotation documented with equitable coverage?

#### D4. Annual review cadence may be too infrequent without interim check-ins
**Area:** Performance Management | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Confirmed: "Just once a year, around your anniversary of joining the company." Performance alignment is referenced early on ("In your first few weeks, you’ll get aligned with your manager and team on approach and expectations."). For a 50–99 person Series B company, lack of structured quarterly check-ins or mid-year promotion/comp windows can slow development and create inequity across fast-growing teams.

**Evidence**
- `doc-006-making-a-career-c001` 37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Beyond the annual review, do managers run quarterly performance check-ins and is there a mid-year promotion/comp review window?

#### D5. PIP policy focuses on coachable skills; equip managers for consistent application
**Area:** Performance Management | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Confirmed: "If your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)." and "However, we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management." At Series B scale, managers typically need a clear toolkit (templates, timelines, documentation standards) and training to apply this policy consistently and compliantly.

**Evidence**
- `doc-006-making-a-career-c002` If your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan PIP .


#### D6. Documented multi-function career ladders and competencies
**Area:** Job architecture | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Confirmed evidence indicates defined expectations across functions: “Acts as a mentor and coach, and provides regular, useful, constructive feedback to teammates.”; “Follows established patterns and approaches within existing code bases with ease.”; “Expert in multiple areas. Leads the team and mentors others on common processes and procedures.”; “You successfully run point on our most complex, critical, big-batch projects… taking them from concept to shipping.” This level of role clarity supports consistent performance management and internal mobility at Series B (50–99). Consider standardizing cross-functional calibration and promotion review to prevent title drift as headcount grows.

**Evidence**
- `doc-017-titles-for-support-c003` idance to teammates, and can act as an unofficial mentor to new L1-L2 Representatives.
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` Our Mobile programming teams iOS and Android have 1 manager overseeing both teams who is responsible for technical leadership and people management.
- `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c002` networking, configuration management, containers, orchestration and with common processes and procedures.


#### D7. Cross-functional leveling frameworks support scalable performance standards
**Area:** Org Design & Career Architecture | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Confirmed: Multiple function-specific rubrics outline expectations and leadership behaviors. For example, "Capable of leading teams of 3+ over an entire discipline." and "Can recognize and raise major incidents and lead the response from inception to resolution." Additionally, "You successfully run point on big-batch projects (4-6 weeks), taking them from concept to shipping alongside a programmer." and "A leader in ensuring robust and effective best practices are understood and followed across the organization." and "Acts as a mentor and coach, and provides regular, useful, constructive feedback to teammates." For a Series B company (50–99 employees), this foundation enables consistent calibration and promotion decisions across teams.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003` A leader on the team, technically and culturally.
- `doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003` ms, know when to employ them in your own work, and introduce new tools and systems to the team.
- `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c003` for when to cut scope to deliver projects on time.


#### D8. Engineering on-call program and incident leadership are explicitly expected
**Area:** Workforce management (on-call) | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Engineering ladders include on-call and incident response: “Participates in programmer on-call rotation under guidance from more senior programmers…” and “Can recognize and raise major incidents and lead the response from inception to resolution.” At Series B, formalize on-call expectations in writing (rotation length, handoffs, escalation paths), and ensure post-incident reviews include workload recovery to reduce burnout risk.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003` A leader on the team, technically and culturally.

### Additional Observations
#### D1. Support spans of control may be narrowly defined (2–4 reps per cohort)
**Area:** Org design and span of control | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Evidence states: “Maintains regular, productive communication with cohorts of 2-4 Reps.” If applied as a standard span for Support managers, this could create managerial overhead and slow scaling at 50–99 employees. Right-size spans and clarify when leads vs. managers carry coaching loads.

**Evidence**
- `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005` Communicates service standards and requirements reliably and effectively to reports.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Is 2–4 direct reports the intended span of control for Support managers today, and what is the target span as the team scales (e.g., 6–8+)?

#### D2. Remote onboarding uses Basecamp and assigned buddies; add 30/60/90 feedback loop
**Area:** Onboarding | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Confirmed: "On your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called “Welcome, [your name]!”" and "Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks." For a Series B team scaling remotely, adding a structured 30/60/90 feedback loop ensures consistency and continuous improvement of the onboarding experience.

**Evidence**
- `doc-004-getting-started-c001` Getting started at 37signals involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely.

**Follow-up questions**

For a 50–99 person Series B company, lack of structured quarterly check-ins or mid-year promotion/comp windows can slow development and create inequity across fast-growing teams.

**Evidence**
- `doc-006-making-a-career-c001` 37signals pays at the top 10% for our industry at San Francisco salary levels, regardless of where you live.

**Follow-up questions**

**Observation:** Confirmed: "If your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)." and "However, we may initiate a PIP to help you improve your performance in a coachable skill like project management." At Series B scale, managers typically need a clear toolkit (templates, timelines, documentation standards) and training to apply this policy consistently and compliantly.

**Evidence**
- `doc-006-making-a-career-c002` If your work performance is not meeting expectations, you may be put on a Performance Improvement Plan PIP .

Leads the team and mentors others on common processes and procedures.”; “You successfully run point on our most complex, critical, big-batch projects… taking them from concept to shipping.” This level of role clarity supports consistent performance management and internal mobility at Series B (50–99). Consider standardizing cross-functional calibration and promotion review to prevent title drift as headcount grows.

**Evidence**
- `doc-017-titles-for-support-c003` idance to teammates, and can act as an unofficial mentor to new L1-L2 Representatives.

For example, "Capable of leading teams of 3+ over an entire discipline." and "Can recognize and raise major incidents and lead the response from inception to resolution." Additionally, "You successfully run point on big-batch projects (4-6 weeks), taking them from concept to shipping alongside a programmer." and "A leader in ensuring robust and effective best practices are understood and followed across the organization." and "Acts as a mentor and coach, and provides regular, useful, constructive feedback to teammates." For a Series B company (50–99 employees), this foundation enables consistent calibration and promotion decisions across teams.

#### D8. Engineering on-call program and incident leadership are explicitly expected
**Area:** Workforce management (on-call) | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Engineering ladders include on-call and incident response: “Participates in programmer on-call rotation under guidance from more senior programmers…” and “Can recognize and raise major incidents and lead the response from inception to resolution.” At Series B, formalize on-call expectations in writing (rotation length, handoffs, escalation paths), and ensure post-incident reviews include workload recovery to reduce burnout risk.
