Executive Summary
- Stage: Seed | <20 employees (stage inferred; no explicit headcount found) — evidence shows a small company handbook and role-level ladders but not an explicit headcount signal (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`).  
- Most material HR controls are present in handbook-style artifacts (handbook, code of conduct, benefits, onboarding, role ladders) but several legally material compliance controls are not explicitly confirmed in the reviewed sources and are flagged as critical risks. Evidence highlights: handbook and onboarding exist (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`); anti-harassment commitments exist but reporting/operational channels need confirmation (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`); detailed leave/vacation rules exist but overtime/eligibility and jurisdictional rules are not explicit (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).  
- Immediate priority actions (high): confirm/document leave & overtime eligibility rules; document employee/contractor and exempt/non-exempt classification controls; confirm anti-harassment reporting channels (and an alternate neutral contact for retaliation) — see Findings and Recommendations below (each item cites source chunks).

Key findings (evidence-linked)
1) Employee handbook and onboarding artifacts exist and are used
   - Employee handbook described as the central policy source and employees are asked to review it (`doc-001-readme-c001`).  
   - New-hire onboarding uses a role-tailored “Welcome” project with to-do lists and Ops/People touchpoints (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`).

2) Anti-harassment and Code of Conduct exist, but reporting channel coverage at Seed stage is uncertain
   - Code of Conduct prohibits discrimination/harassment and instructs reporting to a manager or People Ops; investigations and confidentiality protections are promised (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
   - Uncertainty: at Seed / <20 headcount a formal People Ops function may not exist. The Code of Conduct’s reliance on “People Ops” creates a gap if no neutral owner is documented in practice — recommend designating an alternate neutral contact (founder not in reporting line or external advisor) and publishing it (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).

3) Leave and time-off (vacation) rules are documented; overtime and cross-jurisdiction eligibility are not explicitly documented
   - Vacation policy detail: 20 days + 11 local holidays; rollover cap and payout on separation documented (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`).  
   - Insurance and eligibility timing (coverage begins/terminates on first/last day) documented (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).  
   - Uncertainty / risk: no explicit overtime eligibility rules or exempt/non-exempt criteria were found in evidence — control flagged as critical and needs confirmation (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`).

4) Employee/contractor and exempt/non‑exempt classification controls are not documented in the reviewed sources
   - No explicit documentation of classification controls (employee vs contractor; FLSA exempt status) was found in the provided artifacts — this is a critical compliance gap to confirm and remediate (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`).

5) Offer/contract templates and confidentiality/IP templates not explicitly found
   - Onboarding and benefits are documented, but no explicit standard offer letter, CIIA/CIIAA or confidentiality/IP template was recovered — flagged as high severity and needs confirmation (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`).

6) Career ladders, leveling and role expectations are well-documented across functions
   - Detailed level-based proficiencies exist for programmers, designers, ops and support (L1–L5 ladders), indicating mature career architecture artifacts (`doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002`, `doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c002`).  
   - Note (stage fit): at <20 headcount, consider simplifying to fewer bands to reduce maintenance (`doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c002`).

7) Performance management and PIP approach is documented and seed-stage appropriate
   - Formal review cadence (3, 6, 12 months in year one; annual thereafter) and PIP guidance (used only for short-term, coachable issues) are documented (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c002`).  
   - Operational suggestion (stage-aware): adopt a short (2–4 week) improvement sprint for coachable gaps rather than lengthy PIPs — aligns with documented intent (`doc-006-making-a-career-c002`).

8) HRIS / system of record unclear
   - Benefits and many details are stored in Basecamp but no single HRIS system of record was identified in the evidence — this creates manual data/friction risk as headcount grows (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).

Top growth areas & required actions (prioritized)
(Each action is conditional: implement if not already in place. Owners suggested in parentheses follow the evidence pack recommendations.)

A. Confirm and document leave & overtime eligibility rules (Critical)
   - Why: vacation rules are present but overtime/eligibility rules and jurisdictional specifics are not explicit in sources (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-001-readme-c001`).  
   - Actions: assign owner; produce a single Leave & Overtime policy that includes exempt/non-exempt eligibility, overtime pay rules, jurisdiction-specific leaves, tracking/approval process, and link into handbook and onboarding (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`). (Owner: TBD / assign (e.g., HR/People, Finance, Ops).)

B. Document employee/contractor and exempt/non-exempt classification controls (Critical)
   - Why: no explicit classification controls were recovered; misclassification risk is material (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`).  
   - Actions: define classification decision rules, review triggers on role/work-pattern change, and document approval/owner and audit cadence. Add to handbook and manager training. (Owner: People Team.)

C. Confirm anti-harassment reporting channels and designate alternate neutral contact (Critical / high)
   - Why: Code of Conduct requires reporting to People Ops, and non-retaliation is promised, but a neutral alternate contact is not documented for small teams (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
   - Actions: publish explicit, named reporting contacts (including alternate neutral contact if People Ops function is not staffed), add clear retaliation escalation path in handbook and onboarding (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`). (Owner: TBD / assign.)

D. Establish standard offer letter and confidentiality/IP templates (High)
   - Why: no standard offer/CIIA template was found; this risks inconsistent terms and IP ownership gaps (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`).  
   - Actions: maintain master templates (offer, confidentiality/IP, contractor SOW), add approval workflow, store in single SOR. (Owner: People Team.)

E. Identify a single HRIS or lightweight system-of-record (High)
   - Why: benefits/docs live in Basecamp but no HRIS SOR was identified; a lightweight HRIS reduces fragmentation as you scale (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).  
   - Actions: shortlist simple HRIS options (BambooHR/Rippling/Paylocity) or a disciplined Basecamp + spreadsheet standard; capture required fields and owner for data integrity. (Owner: TBD / assign (e.g., HR/People, Finance, Ops).)

F. Codify onboarding & manager basics, and require baseline manager training (High)
   - Why: onboarding artifacts exist and 1:1 cadence is set, but baseline manager training is not documented in evidence (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`).  
   - Actions: standardize a 1‑day manager primer (1:1 best practices, documentation expectations, ER intake), require for anyone with direct reports; track completion. (Owner: TBD / assign (e.g., People, Ops).)

G. Quick wins to reduce risk (Medium)
   - Offboarding checklist to mirror auto-termination of benefits (deprovision SaaS/hardware) — benefits termination is documented; extend to access revocation (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).  
   - Formalize a small-case ER custodian for documentation and confidentiality (policy references personnel-file documentation) (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
   - Right-size career ladders for Seed stage to 2–3 bands where appropriate to reduce maintenance (`doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c002`).

Recommendations — staged and practical
- Immediate (0–30 days)
  1) Assign owners for the three critical gaps: Leave & Overtime policy, Classification controls, Anti-harassment reporting alternate contact. Publish an owner and expected deliverable date in the handbook (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
  2) Publish a named alternate neutral contact for retaliation concerns (founder or external HR advisor) and add to onboarding materials (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`).

- Near term (30–90 days)
  3) Produce or confirm: a single, version-controlled Offer Letter + Confidentiality/IP template; store centrally and require manager/People sign-off on offers (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
  4) Choose a lightweight HRIS or declare the system-of-record approach and migrate critical employee fields there (payroll, classification, leave balances) — benefits data currently referenced in Basecamp (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).

- Medium term (90–180 days)
  5) Implement baseline manager training (1–2 hour primer + checklist) covering classification review triggers, leave/overtime rules, Code of Conduct intake, and documentation expectations (`doc-006-making-a-career-c002`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
  6) Formalize an offboarding checklist that covers benefits termination, account deprovisioning, and hardware return (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`, `doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001`).

- Are leave and overtime eligibility rules clearly documented for all jurisdictions? (evidence incomplete: `doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`)  
- How is classification reviewed when roles or work patterns change? (no explicit control found: `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`)  
- Is anti-harassment and required bystander training completion tracked by location? (Code of Conduct present; tracking not shown: `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`)  
- Are offer and confidentiality/IP templates standardized and current? (onboarding exists, templates not found: `doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`)  
- Can you confirm: New hires follow a standard onboarding program? (onboarding “Welcome” project exists: `doc-004-getting-started-c001`)  
- Can you confirm: Managers receive baseline people-management training? (not documented in sources)  
- Do you have a current employee handbook and last review date? (handbook present; review date not explicit: `doc-001-readme-c001`)  
- Can you confirm: A single HRIS system of record is identified? (not found; benefits details live in Basecamp: `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`)

Appendix — Selected evidence excerpts (representative)
- Handbook: “In this handbook, you’ll find everything you need to know about 37signals policies and benefits.” (`doc-001-readme-c001`)  
- Onboarding: “On your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called ‘Welcome, [your name]!’ … Ops buddy and your manager will be in contact.” (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`)  
- Anti-harassment / reporting: “37signals prohibits all forms of discrimination and harassment… report it to your manager or to your People Ops team via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated.” (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`)  
- Vacation & benefits timing: “37signals offers 20 days of vacation and personal days plus 11 local holidays… Your vacation time rolls over … You’re eligible for coverage on your first day of employment, and it’s terminated automatically on your final day of employment.” (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`)  
- PIP guidance: “We only initiate PIPs if your manager’s concern is correctable in the short term… we may initiate a PIP to help you improve performance in a coachable skill like project management.” (`doc-006-making-a-career-c002`)  
- Career ladders: role-level definitions for programmers/designers/ops/support are documented (L1–L5 examples) (`doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002`, `doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c002`).

Uncertainties and evidence gaps (explicit)
- Overtime rules, exempt/non-exempt criteria, and contractor vs employee classification controls are not explicitly documented in the reviewed artifacts — flagged as critical (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`).  
- No single HRIS or SOR was identified; benefits and policies are referenced in Basecamp but a system-of-record for employee data is not confirmed (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`).  
- Offer-letter and confidentiality/IP templates were not found in the reviewed sources (needs confirmation) (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`).  
- Manager training program not documented in evidence; recommended as stage-appropriate control to reduce people-risk (`doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c003`).

Methodology (brief)
- Reviewed provided handbook and policy artifacts and extracted control signals by chunked evidence retrieval. Key chunks cited above (e.g., `doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c002`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002`). Full source list and retrieval metrics are in the assessment packet.

Legal note
- This is not legal advice. For classification, overtime, and jurisdictional leave compliance, review with counsel before finalizing policies.
