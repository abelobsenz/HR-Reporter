## About This Assessment
This internal draft evaluates HR maturity and business impact across core functional areas.

Maturity scale:
- `Under-Developed` = reactive or inconsistent controls
- `Developing` = foundational controls exist but are uneven
- `Aligned` = repeatable and documented controls
- `Strategic` = integrated, scalable, and metrics-driven controls

Impact scale:
- `Significant` = materially affects growth, risk, retention, or execution
- `Moderate` = meaningful operational effect, but not existential
- `Limited` = useful improvements, lower urgency at current stage

## Methodology and Data Sources
- Reviewed uploaded files, pasted notes, and supplied URLs.
- Extracted evidence by HR control using deterministic retrieval over chunked sources.
- Generated findings only when controls were explicitly missing or not confirmed in sources; explicit citations were retained where available.
- Reviewed 17 document(s) and 102 evidence chunk(s).
- Source count in assessment packet: 17.

### Source Coverage
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| URLs seeded/fetched | 0 / 0 |
| URL fetch failures | 0 |
| Retrieved docs/chunks | 17 / 102 |
| Domains | None |

**Coverage note:** Sources were prioritized toward broad HR controls; niche/local pages were deprioritized unless directly relevant.

## Stage-Based Recommendations
**Stage context:** Seed | <20 employees

**Recommended HR structure:** Founder-led People operations with fractional HR support; establish minimum viable, compliant people infrastructure before scaling headcount.

### Recommended Employment Practices
- Set baseline legal controls early: handbook, anti-harassment, leave/overtime, complaint and retaliation reporting path.
- Define repeatable hiring and onboarding basics before hiring velocity increases.
- Add a lightweight HRIS to avoid data fragmentation and manual process risk.
- Codify mission, values, and expected behaviors so culture scales intentionally.

### Potential Stage Risks
- Reactive HR execution causes inconsistent decisions and avoidable compliance exposure.
- No structured onboarding increases ramp-time and early attrition risk.
- Founder bottlenecks delay people decisions as team size grows.

### Additional Observations
#### D1. Track state-specific leave (incl. mental health) for remote or multi-state hires
**Area:** Leave Compliance | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** ambiguous

**Observation:** Evidence includes state-level provisions that explicitly cover mental health: "Residents of New Jersey may be eligible for continuous or intermittent leave to care for themselves, a child, or other family member." and "Temporary Disability Insurance to manage your own physical or mental health condition unrelated to your work (including pregnancy and childbirth recovery)." For Seed teams hiring across states, maintaining a simple state leave matrix and communication process prevents compliance misses and supports employee well-being.

**Evidence**
- `doc-012-statefmla-c005` New Jersey Medical and Family Leave Residents of New Jersey may be eligible for continuous or intermittent leave to care for themselves, a child, or other family member.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Which states do you currently employ in, and do you maintain a state-by-state leave matrix (with owner and update cadence) to guide managers and employees on eligibility and process?

#### D2. Put IT offboarding controls in place (MDM, password manager, VPN) from day one
**Area:** Offboarding & Access Control | **Severity:** high | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** The evidence demonstrates simple, high-leverage controls that materially reduce risk: "We centrally manage and secure these devices with Kandji... Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company." and "Here we lean on 1password to provide the employee onboarding/offboarding of access to credentials and our Tailscale VPN to control access to internal systems." For <20 employees, adopting an MDM or, at minimum, password manager + VPN with a documented offboarding checklist prevents lingering access and data loss during turnover.

**Evidence**
- `doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001` With Linux, we run Omarchy, which already comes with the standard configuration needed full-disk encryption, firewall, etc .


#### D3. Career ladders are deeply defined across roles—may be more than a seed-stage team needs
**Area:** Org design / Job architecture | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence: "On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3). All Leads and Principals report directly to our CTO." Evidence: "Capable of leading teams of 3+ over an entire discipline." For a Seed | <20 employees company, a simplified 2–3 band structure often suffices while still conveying expectations and growth paths.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers L4 and Principal Programmers L5 act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers L1-3 .
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c004` documentation, and process that improve team effectiveness, reduce friction, and strengthen shared resources.


#### D4. Use a project-based onboarding with manager and buddy to-do ownership
**Area:** Onboarding | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** A lightweight approach that creates accountability without an HRIS: "On your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called ‘Welcome, [your name]!’." with "Your welcome project will contain a few to-do lists, tailored to your role and linking to accounts or services that you need to set up." and "You’ll also see to-do lists that your Ops buddy and manager will be working through." For Seed stage, mirroring this in your task tool ensures both the new hire and the responsible adults (manager/buddy) have clear, trackable setup actions.

**Evidence**
- `doc-004-getting-started-c002` On your first day, youll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called Welcome, your name !.


#### D5. Define explicit tech-lead people-management responsibilities early
**Area:** Manager Enablement | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence shows a lightweight but explicit outline of tech-lead duties that cover day-to-day people leadership without a large HR function: "On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3)." and tech leads are responsible for "Providing People Ops with the key input to annual performance reviews." and "Identifying and escalating slips in performance or process to People Ops." For a Seed stage (<20) team, creating a 1-page role card for leads with these responsibilities can substitute for heavier manager training programs while keeping performance and coaching on track.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` Our Mobile programming teams iOS and Android have 1 manager overseeing both teams who is responsible for technical leadership and people management.


#### D6. Tech leads own key people processes alongside People Ops
**Area:** Performance management / Manager enablement | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence: "On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3)." Evidence: "Providing People Ops with the key input to annual performance reviews." Evidence: "Identifying and escalating slips in performance or process to People Ops." For Seed | <20, explicitly assigning these duties (even if there’s no formal People Ops yet) prevents drift on reviews and performance coaching.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers L4 and Principal Programmers L5 act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers L1-3 .


#### D7. Dual-buddy onboarding model (role buddy + Ops buddy) supports remote ramp
**Area:** Onboarding | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence: "Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks." For seed-stage teams, mirroring this with a role buddy plus an Ops/IT checklist owner speeds access setup and social integration without heavy process.

**Evidence**
- `doc-004-getting-started-c002` Getting started at 37signals involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely.


#### D8. Combine technical leadership and people management to conserve headcount
**Area:** Org Design | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** A pragmatic pattern for small teams is to consolidate leadership across adjacent domains: "Our Mobile programming teams (iOS and Android) have 1 manager overseeing both teams who is responsible for technical leadership and people management." For a Seed-stage startup, this model avoids premature specialization while still providing clear accountability for both delivery and people.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003` Occasional issues following patterns and approaches within existing code bases.

**Observation:** Evidence includes state-level provisions that explicitly cover mental health: "Residents of New Jersey may be eligible for continuous or intermittent leave to care for themselves, a child, or other family member." and "Temporary Disability Insurance to manage your own physical or mental health condition unrelated to your work (including pregnancy and childbirth recovery)." For Seed teams hiring across states, maintaining a simple state leave matrix and a communication process prevents compliance misses and supports employee well-being.

**Evidence**
- `doc-012-statefmla-c005` New Jersey Medical and Family Leave Residents of New Jersey may be eligible for continuous or intermittent leave to care for themselves, a child, or other family member.

**Follow-up questions**
1. Which states do you currently employ in, and do you maintain a state-by-state leave matrix (with owner and update cadence) to guide managers and employees on eligibility and process?

#### D2. Put IT offboarding controls in place (MDM, password manager, VPN) from day one
**Area:** Offboarding & Access Control | **Severity:** high | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** The evidence shows straightforward, high-leverage controls that materially reduce risk: "We centrally manage and secure these devices with Kandji... Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company." and "Here we lean on 1password to provide the employee onboarding/offboarding of access to credentials and our Tailscale VPN to control access to internal systems." For <20 employees, adopting an MDM or, at minimum, a password manager plus VPN with a documented offboarding checklist prevents lingering access and data loss during turnover.

**Evidence**
- `doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001` With Linux, we run Omarchy, which already comes with the standard configuration needed full-disk encryption, firewall, etc .


#### D3. Career ladders are deeply defined across roles—may be more than a seed-stage team needs
**Area:** Org design / Job architecture | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence: "On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3). All Leads and Principals report directly to our CTO." Evidence: "Capable of leading teams of 3+ over an entire discipline." For a Seed | <20 employees company, a simplified 2–3 band structure often suffices while still conveying expectations and growth paths.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers L4 and Principal Programmers L5 act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers L1-3 .
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c004` documentation, and process that improve team effectiveness, reduce friction, and strengthen shared resources.


#### D4. Use a project-based onboarding with manager and buddy to-do ownership
**Area:** Onboarding | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** A lightweight approach that creates accountability without an HRIS: "On your first day, you’ll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called ‘Welcome, [your name]!’." with "Your welcome project will contain a few to-do lists, tailored to your role and linking to accounts or services that you need to set up." and "You’ll also see to-do lists that your Ops buddy and manager will be working through." For Seed stage, mirroring this in your task tool ensures both the new hire and the responsible adults (manager/buddy) have clear, trackable setup actions.

**Evidence**
- `doc-004-getting-started-c002` On your first day, youll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called Welcome, your name !.


#### D5. Define explicit tech-lead people-management responsibilities early
**Area:** Manager Enablement | **Severity:** medium | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence shows a lightweight but explicit outline of tech-lead duties that cover day-to-day people leadership without a large HR function: "On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3)." and tech leads are responsible for "Providing People Ops with the key input to annual performance reviews." and "Identifying and escalating slips in performance or process to People Ops." For a Seed stage (<20) team, creating a one-page role card for leads with these responsibilities can substitute for heavier manager training while keeping performance and coaching on track.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` Our Mobile programming teams iOS and Android have 1 manager overseeing both teams who is responsible for technical leadership and people management.


#### D6. Tech leads own key people processes alongside People Ops
**Area:** Performance management / Manager enablement | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence: "On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3)." Evidence: "Providing People Ops with the key input to annual performance reviews." Evidence: "Identifying and escalating slips in performance or process to People Ops." For Seed | <20, explicitly assigning these duties (even if there’s no formal People Ops yet) prevents drift on reviews and performance coaching.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002` On Web and SIP programming teams, Lead Programmers L4 and Principal Programmers L5 act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers L1-3 .


#### D7. Dual-buddy onboarding model (role buddy + Ops buddy) supports remote ramp
**Area:** Onboarding | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** Evidence: "Your teammates, your manager, your 37signals buddy, your Ops buddy, and our People team are all here to help as you navigate your first few days and weeks." For seed-stage teams, mirroring this with a role buddy plus an Ops/IT checklist owner speeds access setup and social integration without heavy process.

**Evidence**
- `doc-004-getting-started-c002` Getting started at 37signals involves a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, learning the details of your new job, meeting new coworkers, all while working remotely.


#### D8. Combine technical leadership and people management to conserve headcount
**Area:** Org Design | **Severity:** low | **Evidence status:** present

**Observation:** A pragmatic pattern for small teams is to consolidate leadership across adjacent domains: "Our Mobile programming teams (iOS and Android) have 1 manager overseeing both teams who is responsible for technical leadership and people management." For a Seed-stage startup, this model avoids premature specialization while still providing clear accountability for both delivery and people.

**Evidence**
- `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003` Occasional issues following patterns and approaches within existing code bases.
