Executive Summary
- Stage: Seed | <20 employees (founder-led people operations recommended). Assessment reviewed 17 documents (36 evidence chunks). Key strengths: basic handbook/employee resources, documented job level frameworks, project-based onboarding, and a clear performance review cadence. Key gaps (prioritized): several critical compliance controls not explicitly documented in reviewed sources—leave/overtime eligibility, worker classification controls, anti-harassment reporting, standardized offer/IP templates—and systems gaps (single HRIS) that raise operational and compliance risk as hiring accelerates. See prioritized actions below. Evidence and claims are tied to source chunks; where evidence is weak or conflicting this is flagged as uncertainty. (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c001`) 

Top findings (priority order)
1) Leave & overtime policies — critical gap
   - Finding: Leave and overtime eligibility rules are not explicitly confirmed in source artifacts; control flagged as required at this stage. (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`)
   - Risk: Non‑documented eligibility rules increase compliance exposure (payroll, overtime, jurisdictional leave).
   - Certainty: Evidence not provided in reviewed sources (needs confirmation).

2) Worker classification controls — critical gap
   - Finding: No explicit documentation found for employee vs contractor and exempt vs non‑exempt classification controls. (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c006`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`)
   - Risk: Misclassification risk can create payroll, tax, and benefits liabilities.
   - Certainty: Not confirmed in sources (needs action).

3) Anti‑harassment policy & reporting channels — critical uncertainty
   - Finding: Code of Conduct is present (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`), but the checklist flagged anti‑harassment policy and reporting channels as not explicitly provided in sources. There is conflicting signal in the packet; this creates uncertainty about whether a complete anti‑harassment policy (with reporting/SLAs/training tracking) is published and tracked. (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`)
   - Risk: Missing/unclear anti‑harassment procedures and training tracking elevate litigation and culture risk.
   - Certainty: Conflict/uncertainty — please confirm.

4) Offer letters, confidentiality/IP templates — high gap
   - Finding: No explicit evidence of standardized offer letter and confidentiality/IP templates in the reviewed artifacts. (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`, `doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`, `doc-011-severance-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`)
   - Risk: Inconsistent offer language risks enforceability of IP/confidentiality and inconsistent terms.

5) Onboarding basics & manager training — high gap (mixed signals)
   - Finding: There is an explicit project-based onboarding practice with Ops + peer buddies on day one (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`), but the checklist notes “New hires follow a standard onboarding program” and “Managers receive baseline people-management training” were not explicitly confirmed. (`doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c002`, `doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c003`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`)
   - Risk: Inconsistent onboarding or untrained managers increase ramp time and early attrition.
   - Certainty: Onboarding activity present; standardization and manager training need confirmation.

6) HRIS / single system of record — high gap
   - Finding: No single HRIS system of record was identified in reviewed sources. (`doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`, `doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001`)
   - Risk: Fragmented people data increases manual work, error risk, and audit exposure.
   - Certainty: Not confirmed — recommend naming an SOR.

Confirmed strengths and positive signals
- Employee handbook / handbook presence referenced on Basecamp. (`doc-001-readme-c001`)
- Benefits baseline: life insurance coverage and time off described (20 vacation/personal days + 11 local holidays). (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`)
- Project-based onboarding with Ops + peer buddies is explicitly described. (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`)
- Documented job architecture and multi-function career frameworks exist across Design, Engineering, Support, Ops. (`doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c003`)
- Performance cadence: formal reviews at 3/6/12 months and PIP policy for short-term/coach‑able gaps. (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c002`)
- Org design note: Mobile iOS and Android teams share a single manager (single point of escalation). (`doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c001`)

Stage-aware recommendations (practical, founder-led, prioritized)
Immediate (30 days)
- Assign owners and quick wins
  - Designate an HR owner (founder or fractional HR) to own compliance checklist and handbook updates. (related: `doc-001-readme-c001`)
  - Confirm anti‑harassment policy contents and reporting channels; if missing, publish a short policy and a clear reporting contact. (start from `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`) — mark as high priority.
  - Publish or confirm leave/overtime eligibility rules (vacation/holidays exist, but eligibility and overtime policy must be explicit). (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`)
  - Create a single, lightweight offboarding checklist that ties benefits termination to IT deprovisioning and equipment return. (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`)
- Ask for confirmation on missing artifacts listed in follow‑up questions (see next section).

Short term (60 days)
- Formalize classification controls
  - Document employee vs contractor and exempt vs non‑exempt decision rules and a review trigger (role change, location change). (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c006`)
- Standardize offer and confidentiality/IP templates
  - Create standard offer letter(s) and confidentiality/IP addendum templates and store in a single SOR. (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-011-severance-c001`, `doc-004-getting-started-c001`)
- Identify HRIS SOR or commit to a minimally viable HRIS (payroll + people record + benefits) or a documented manual owner/process until SOR is adopted. (`doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`)

Medium term (90 days)
- Standardize onboarding & manager enablement
  - Codify the project-based onboarding into a repeatable checklist (role-specific) and confirm Ops + peer buddy responsibilities across roles. (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`)
  - Deliver baseline manager training (hiring, feedback, performance reviews, basic ER), track completion. (`doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c003`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`)
- Anti‑retaliation & ER SLAs
  - Ensure the Code of Conduct / ER process explicitly references anti‑retaliation protections and target timelines for investigations and communications. (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`)
- Operationalize people strategy basics
  - Document a simple people/HR strategy aligned to near-term business priorities (hiring plan, role types, pay posture). (`doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c002`, `doc-010-our-rituals-c001`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c002`)

Risks and mitigations (concise)
- Compliance (critical): missing leave/overtime, classification, anti‑harassment, handbook currency. Mitigate by immediate owner assignment, publish missing policies, and schedule quarterly policy reviews. (`doc-001-readme-c001`, `doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-006-making-a-career-c001`)
- Operational (high): no single HRIS SOR and no standardized offer templates. Mitigate by identifying an SOR or interim owner and templating offer/IP documents. (`doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`, `doc-011-severance-c001`)
- Manager bandwidth (medium): single manager for iOS + Android creates a single point of failure. Mitigate via delegated tech leads and an escalation backup for people matters. (`doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c001`)

Follow-up questions (please confirm / provide artifacts)
- Are leave and overtime eligibility rules clearly documented for all jurisdictions? (`doc-002-benefits-and-perks-c002`, `doc-001-readme-c001`)
- How is worker classification reviewed when roles or work patterns change? (`doc-006-making-a-career-c001`, `doc-016-titles-for-programmers-c003`)
- Is anti‑harassment policy (including anti‑retaliation and investigation SLAs) published and is training completion tracked by location? (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`)
- Are offer and confidentiality/IP templates standardized and current? (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-011-severance-c001`)
- Can you confirm: New hires follow a standard onboarding program (repeatable checklist beyond the welcome project)? (`doc-004-getting-started-c001`, `doc-017-titles-for-support-c005`)
- Can you confirm: Managers receive baseline people-management training and its tracking status? (`doc-014-titles-for-designers-c003`, `doc-015-titles-for-ops-c003`)
- Do you have a current employee handbook and last review date? (`doc-001-readme-c001`)
- Can you confirm: a single HRIS system of record is identified? (`doc-007-managing-work-devices-c001`, `doc-009-our-internal-systems-c001`)

Notes on evidence quality and uncertainty
- Several checklist controls were not explicitly confirmed in the reviewed artifacts; these are documented as “not_provided_in_sources” in the assessment and should be validated. Where packet items both indicate presence and absence of a control (notably anti‑harassment/Code of Conduct signals), the summary flags that as uncertainty requiring confirmation. (`doc-003-code-of-conduct-c001`, `doc-001-readme-c001`)

If you want, I can:
- Draft the minimal policy templates referenced above (leave/overtime, classification decision guide, anti‑harassment statement, offer/IP template) for rapid adoption.
- Produce a 30/60/90 operational checklist with owners and suggested wording for core policies and onboarding.
